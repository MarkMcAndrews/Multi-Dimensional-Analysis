# Multi-Dimensional-Analysis
Code for a POS-driven MD analysis using the Stanford Tagger and R

The code is semi-flexible in that it was originially written to perform an MD analysis of a particular version of the English Protestant Bible, but can be modified for any (collection of) text(s).

This project includes the following documents:
1. "MD-code" contains all code used for MD analysis (all in R, except running the Tagger from Unix command line)
2. "MD-code.txt" download code in .txt file
3. "NIV-Bible.txt" the version of the New International Version Bible used in the original MD analysis
4. "Tagged-Bible-Books.zip" folder containing the POS-tagged versions of the 66 books of the NIV-Bible.txt file
